# Tabliss Configuration
Tabliss is an amazing way to showcase your new Chrome/Firefox/Edge tab page. It's a great way to get inspired and motivated. This repository contains my configuration for Tabliss.

## Configuration
The configuration file called [simple-green](/configuration/simple-green.json) is a JSON file that contains all the settings for a stunning Tabliss setup. You can use this file to get started with Tabliss or as a reference for configuring your own setup.

To use this configuration, simply import the settings and everything will be set up accordingly.
